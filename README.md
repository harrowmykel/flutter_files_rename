# flutter_files_rename

This file tries to automatically rename and replace all .dart files 
in your folder if you get the error that 

-- Name source files using lowercase_with_underscores.dart(file_names)


just run 

`python rename_dart_files_to_underscore.py`

and wait... the code is really slow 

I will optimize later
