# flutter_files_rename

This file tries to automatically rename and replace all .dart files 
in your folder if you get the error that 

-- Name source files using lowercase_with_underscores.dart(file_names)


![Sample_Error](/112788756-8850fd00-9029-11eb-923d-6defc9171197.png?raw=true "Sample Error")

just 
1. clone project 

2. copy rename_dart_files_to_underscore.py to your flutter root folder (in the same folder as pubspec.yaml)

3. update 'relative_or_absolute_path_to_file' (only if necessary)

4. run `python rename_dart_files_to_underscore.py`

and wait... the code is really slow!

I will optimize later
